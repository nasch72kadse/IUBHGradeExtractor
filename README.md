# IUBHGradeExtractor
### Running the TelegramBot

The IUBHGradeExtractor uses the [pyTelegramBotAPI](/https://github.com/eternnoir/pyTelegramBotAPI) to setup the bot.
First a Telegram Bot Key must be generated, how this works exactly is described [here](/https://core.telegram.org/bots).
Then you have to setup the config file in the configuration folder and enter your authorization token. 

The chromedriver is currently using version 88, if you are using a different version of Chrome, please update the chromedriver file.
